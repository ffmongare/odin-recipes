    <h3 class="third">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="third">4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li class="third">cayenne pepper to taste</li>
        <li class="third">salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li class="third">all-purpose flour for dredging</li>
        <li class="third">2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li class="third">1 tablespoon capers, drained</li>
        <li class="third">½ cup white wine</li>
        <li class="third">¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li class="third">¼ cup water</li>
        <li class="third">3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut in 1/4-inch slices</li>
        <li class="third">2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="third">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li class="third">Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly
            pound chicken
            breasts with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/2-inch thickness.</li>
        <li class="third">Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper; dredge lightly in
            flour and shake
            off any excess.</li>
        <li class="third">Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to
            medium, and cook
            until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.</li>
        <li class="third">Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed through,
            about 30 seconds.
        </li>
        <li class="third">Pour white wine into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food
            off the bottom
            of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li class="third">Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and stir continuously
            to form a
            thick sauce, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.</li>
        <li class="third">Return chicken breasts to the pan and cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with
            sauce spooned
            over the top.</li>
    </ol>
